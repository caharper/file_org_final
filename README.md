File Organization and Database Management Final Project

To run, make sure you have MongoDB installed
    If typing mongod in the command line does something, it should be fine

From this directory, open two terminals:
    1. In the first terminal, execute the following command to start up the mongo instance:
    mongod --dbpath ./database

    2. In the second terminal execute the following command to start up the GUI:
    python db_gui.py
